# NHS Training Scheme Application Data 
I scraped NHS data on who applies and is accepted to the training scheme using BeautifulSoup. I then used Pandas to create a dataframe 

I scraped the "accepted offers" table from this site: https://medical.hee.nhs.uk/medical-training-recruitment/medical-specialty-training/equality-and-diversity/equality-and-diversity-2023-recruitment-data/country-of-qualification-2023-recruitment-data
